	      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<h5>What is this?</h5>
				<p>This is a list of companies that could be described as <em>digital manufacturers</em>. Their products are mostly coded in Scotland, and they display &ldquo;Made in Scotland&rdquo; as prominently as their copyright message.</p>
				<h5>Isn&rsquo;t this just like Made in NYC?</h5>
				<p>Well spotted. The project is directly inspired by <a href="https://www.nytech.org/made/">Made in NYC</a>. Don&rsquo;t worry, they know about us.</p>
				<h5>Sweet. How can I add my company or project?</h5>
				<p>Simply <a href="https://github.com/ludometrics/madeinscotland/pulls">open a pull request</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/ludometrics/madeinscotland">source repo</a>.</p>
				<h5>What does &lsquo;mostly coded in Scotland&rsquo; mean?</h5>
				<p>Over 50% of the code for product(s) was written in Scotland.</p>
				<h5>How do you verify that fact?</h5>
				<p>For now, we use the honour system (unlike Made in NYC, which uses the honor system).</p>
				<h5>My company is based in Scotland, but our technology is mostly made/coded elsewhere. Can we be listed?</h5>
				<p>No. This list is designed to show that great digital products are being made here in Scotland.</p>
				<h5>Why the strict &lsquo;mostly coded in Scotland&rsquo; rule?</h5>
				<p>To paraphrase Made in NYC: Because tech is coded, so made means made. Made doesnâ€™t mean funded or managed. Like a shirt that&rsquo;s designed/licensed/funded in Scotland, and made in China: it&rsquo;s Made in China, not Made in Scotland. Made means made.</p>
				<h5>Is there a logo we can display?</h5>
				<p>There&rsquo;s no official logo, but see below for what you should display on your product.</p>
				<h5>What&rsquo;s the point of this?</h5>
				<p>Again, paraphrasing Made in NYC: If Scotland is to thrive in the 21st century, Scotland needs to make more digital things. We already have some great companies here, so let&rsquo;s proudly show ourselves off in the hope that everyone everywhere (including software engineers who don&rsquo;t live here already) knows what digital things are being made in Scotland.</p>
				<h5>What should I display on my site or product?</h5>
				<p>Simply put the words &ldquo;Made in Scotland&rdquo; next to your standard copyright message. Feel free to use some adverbs or mix it up, such as &ldquo;Lovingly Made in Scotland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hand-Crafted in Scotland&rdquo;.</p>
				<h5>Where should I send suggestions?</h5>
				<p>Just raise a PR or issue on <a href="https://github.com/ludometrics/madeinscotland">GitHub</a></p>
